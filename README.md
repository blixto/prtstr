# prtstr
Just a silly implementation of a primitive string printing function in pure ANSI C.

Obs.: "c.ps1" compiles the source and puts the generated .exe and .obj files into two directories: bin and obj, respectively. If the directories doesn't exist, it creates them first. The file "x.ps1" executes the .exe file in a slightly more convenient way, so it is expected that at least one successful compilation was achieved before executing it.

Obs. 2: Although this project is using Microsoft dev't gear, the code is very portable, and will run on most platforms/OSes.
